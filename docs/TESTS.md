## Running and testing your solutions

### Overview

Suppose you're solving __halting\-problem__:

* Start a REPL, either in your favorite editor or from the
command line\.
* Type `(load "halting-problem.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\. At first this should result in failed tests\.
* Develop your solution in "halting\-problem\.scm" and
reload the file to run the tests again\.

### Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\.
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the input and output together call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
