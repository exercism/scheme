# Scrabble Score

Given a word, compute the Scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```text
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Extensions

# Running and testing your solutions

## Overview

Suppose you're solving __hello\-world__:

* Start a REPL, either in your favorite editor or from the
command line\.
* Type `(load "hello-world.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\.

## Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\. 
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the output as well call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
