## Track Specific Notes

You must return the anagrams in the same order as they are listed in the candidate words.

## Running and testing your solutions


### From the command line

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile.
Sometimes the name for the scheme binary on your system will differ from the defaults.
When this is the case, you'll need to tell make by running `make chez chez=your-chez-binary` or `make guile guile=your-guile-binary`.

### From a REPL

* Enter `(load "test.scm")` at the repl prompt.
* Develop your solution in `anagram.scm` reloading as you go.
* Run `(test)` to check your solution.

### Failed Test Cases

If some of the test cases fail, you should see the failing input and the expected output.
The failing input is presented as a list because the tests call your solution by `(apply anagram input-list)`.
To learn more about `apply` see [The Scheme Programming Language -- Chapter 5](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/control.html#./control:h1).
