# Sublist

Given two lists determine if the first list is contained within the second
list, if the second list is contained within the first list, if both lists are
contained within each other or if none of these are true.

Specifically, a list A is a sublist of list B if by dropping 0 or more elements
from the front of B and 0 or more elements from the back of B you get a list
that's completely equal to A.

Examples:

 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4, 5], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3], A is equal to B
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [2, 3, 4], A is a superlist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is not a superlist of, sublist of or equal to B

## Running and testing your solutions

### From the command line

NB: Unlike other exercises in this track, the tests for this exercise *only*
work with __GNU Guile__ (not Chez Scheme).

Simply execute,

```sh
$ guile test.scm
```

By default, only the first test is executed when you run the command. This is
intentional, as it allows you to focus on just making that one test pass. Once
it passes, you can enable the next test(s) by removing or commenting out
`(test-skip ...)`. When all tests have been enabled and your implementation
makes them all pass, you'll have solved the exercise!

### Failed Test Cases

If some of the test cases fail, you should be able to check the actual input
and the expected output from the log file (`sublist.log`).

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
