# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Track Specific Notes

## Running and testing your solutions

### Overview


* Start a REPL either in your favorite editor or from
the command line\.
* Type `(load "rna-transcription.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\.
* Develop the solution in `rna-transcription.scm` and reload as you go\.

### Testing options

You can see more or less information about
failing test cases an by passing additional arguments to the
procedure `test`\.
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the input and output together call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
