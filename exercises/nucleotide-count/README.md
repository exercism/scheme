# Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA.
DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides.
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.

Here is an analogy:
- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA as
- legos are to lego houses as
- words are to sentences as...

# Running and testing your solutions

## Overview

Suppose you're solving __hello\-world__:

* Start a REPL, either in your favorite editor or from the
command line\.
* Type `(load "hello-world.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\.

## Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\. 
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the output as well call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
