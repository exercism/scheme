# Two Fer

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```text
One for X, one for me.
```

Where X is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |String to return 
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me. 
|Bob     |One for Bob, one for me.
|        |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.

## Track Specific Notes

One way to get optional arguments in scheme is by specifying the arguments as a list\.
Two ways to do that are: `(define (two-fer . args) ...)` or `(define two-fer (lambda args ...))`\.
## Running and testing your solutions

### Overview


* Start a REPL either in your favorite editor or from
the command line\.
* Type `(load "two-fer.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\.
* Develop the solution in `two-fer.scm` and reload as you go\.

### Testing options

You can see more or less information about
failing test cases an by passing additional arguments to the
procedure `test`\.
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the input and output together call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
