# Raindrops

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation).

The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:

- has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
- has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
- has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
- _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".



## Running and testing your solutions



### From the command line

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile\.


### From a REPL

* Enter `test.scm` at the repl prompt\.
* Develop your solution in `raindrops.scm` reloading as you go\.
* Run `(test)` to check your solution\.
