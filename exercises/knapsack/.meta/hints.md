## Track Specific Notes

In the scheme version the aruguments are the `capacity` of the knapsack and a list of the `weights` and a list of the `values`\.
It won't be necessary to validate the input \-\- the
test inputs have valid values and same length lists\.


## Running and testing your solutions



### From the command line

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile\.


### From a REPL

* Enter `test.scm` at the repl prompt\.
* Develop your solution in `knapsack.scm` reloading as you go\.
* Run `(test)` to check your solution\.



### Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\.
 To see the failing input and output call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
