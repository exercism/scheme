# Armstrong Numbers

An [Armstrong number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

- 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`
- 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`
- 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`
- 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`

Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

## Running and testing your solutions

### From the command line

NB: Unlike other exercises in this track, the tests for this exercise *only*
work with __GNU Guile__ (not Chez Scheme).

Simply execute,

```sh
$ guile test.scm
```

By default, only the first test is executed when you run the command. This is
intentional, as it allows you to focus on just making that one test pass. Once
it passes, you can enable the next test(s) by removing or commenting out
`(test-skip ...)`. When all tests have been enabled and your implementation
makes them all pass, you'll have solved the exercise!

### Failed Test Cases

If some of the test cases fail, you should be able to check the actual input
and the expected output from the log file (`armstrong-numbers.log`).
