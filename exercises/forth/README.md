# Forth

Implement an evaluator for a very simple subset of Forth.

[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29)
is a stack-based programming language. Implement a very basic evaluator
for a small subset of Forth.

Your evaluator has to support the following words:

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (integer arithmetic)
- `DUP`, `DROP`, `SWAP`, `OVER` (stack manipulation)

Your evaluator also has to support defining new words using the
customary syntax: `: word-name definition ;`.

To keep things simple the only data type you need to support is signed
integers of at least 16 bits size.

You should use the following rules for the syntax: a number is a
sequence of one or more (ASCII) digits, a word is a sequence of one or
more letters, digits, symbols or punctuation that is not a number.
(Forth probably uses slightly different rules, but this is close
enough.)

Words are case-insensitive.


## Track Specific Notes

The input is presented as a list of strings\.
Definitions are presented as `: var x ... ;` where `var` is bound to what follows\.
Otherwise the string represents a sequence of stack manipulations\.

## Running and testing your solutions


### From the command line

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile\.

### From a REPL

* Enter `test.scm` at the repl prompt\.
* Develop your solution in `forth.scm` reloading as you go\.
* Run `(test)` to check your solution\.


### Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\.
 To see the failing input and output call `(test 'input 'output)`\.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
