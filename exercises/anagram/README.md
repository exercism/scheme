# Anagram

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

# Notes

For purposes of this exercise, a word is not
considered to be an anagram of itself\.


# Running and testing your solutions

## Overview

Suppose you're solving __halting\-problem__:

* Start a REPL, either in your favorite editor or from the
command line\.
* Type `(load "halting-problem.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\. At first this should result in failed tests\.
* Develop your solution in "halting\-problem\.scm" and
reload the file to run the tests again\.

## Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\. 
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the input and output together call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
