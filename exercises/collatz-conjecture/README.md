# Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is
odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely.
The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will
always reach 1 eventually.

Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

## Examples

Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

0. 12
1. 6
2. 3
3. 10
4. 5
5. 16
6. 8
7. 4
8. 2
9. 1

Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.


## Track Specific Notes

Don't worry about validating input for this track \-\- all inputs will be natural numbers\.

## Running and testing your solutions


### From the command line

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile\.
Sometimes the name for the scheme binary on your system will differ from the defaults\.
When this is the case, you'll need to tell make by running `make chez chez=your-chez-binary` or `make guile guile=your-guile-binary`\.

### From a REPL

* Enter `(load "test.scm")` at the repl prompt\.
* Develop your solution in `collatz-conjecture.scm` reloading as you go\.
* Run `(test)` to check your solution\.

### Failed Test Cases

If some of the test cases fail, you should see the failing input and the expected output\.
The failing input is presented as a list because the tests call your solution by `(apply collatz-conjecture input-list)`\.
To learn more about `apply` see [The Scheme Programming Language -- Chapter 5](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/control.html#./control:h1)
