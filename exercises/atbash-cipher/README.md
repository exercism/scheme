# Atbash Cipher

Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.

The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on
transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting
alphabet is backwards. The first letter is replaced with the last
letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.

An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

```text
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
```

It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is
a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher. However, this may not have
been an issue in the cipher's time.

Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size
being 5 letters, and punctuation is excluded. This is to make it harder to guess
things based on word boundaries.

## Examples

- Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`
- Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`
- Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`

# Running and testing your solutions

## Overview

Suppose you're solving __halting\-problem__:

* Start a REPL, either in your favorite editor or from the
command line\.
* Type `(load "halting-problem.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\. At first this should result in failed tests\.
* Develop your solution in "halting\-problem\.scm" and
reload the file to run the tests again\.

## Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\.
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the input and output together call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
