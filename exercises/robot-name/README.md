# Robot Name

Manage robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated in the format
of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings,
which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will
respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution must ensure that
every existing robot has a unique name.

# Running and testing your solutions

## Overview

Suppose you're solving __halting\-problem__:

* Start a REPL, either in your favorite editor or from the
command line\.
* Type `(load "halting-problem.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\. At first this should result in failed tests\.
* Develop your solution in "halting\-problem\.scm" and
reload the file to run the tests again\.

## Testing options

You can see more information about failing test cases by passing
arguments to the procedure `test`\. 
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the input and output together call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
