# Roman Numerals

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled
it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and
even bikinis. One thing they never discovered though was the number
zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits
slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with
is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date
their programmes.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice
these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack
into stone tablets).

```text
 1  => I
10  => X
 7  => VII
```

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000.
(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each
digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any
digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.

In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:

1000=M
900=CM
90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:

2000=MM
8=VIII

## Running and testing your solutions

### From the command line

NB: Unlike other exercises in this track, the tests for this exercise *only*
work with __GNU Guile__ (not Chez Scheme).

Simply execute,

```sh
$ guile test.scm
```

By default, only the first test is executed when you run the command. This is
intentional, as it allows you to focus on just making that one test pass. Once
it passes, you can enable the next test(s) by removing or commenting out
`(test-skip ...)`. When all tests have been enabled and your implementation
makes them all pass, you'll have solved the exercise!

### Failed Test Cases

If some of the test cases fail, you should be able to check the actual input
and the expected output from the log file (`roman-numerals.log`).
