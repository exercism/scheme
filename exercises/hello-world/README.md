The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Track Specific Notes

Your solution may be a procedure that
returns the desired string or a variable whose value is that
string\.
## Running and testing your solutions

### Overview


* Start a REPL either in your favorite editor or from
the command line\.
* Type `(load "hello-world.scm")` at the prompt\.
* Test your code by calling `(test)` from the REPL\.
* Develop the solution in `hello-world.scm` and reload as you go\.

### Testing options

You can see more or less information about
failing test cases an by passing additional arguments to the
procedure `test`\.
To see the failing input call `(test 'input)` and to see the input and output together call `(test 'input 'output)`\.
